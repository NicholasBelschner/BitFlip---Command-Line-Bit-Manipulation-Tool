# BitFlip---Command-Line-Bit-Manipulation-Tool
BitFlip is a C program that provides a command-line interface for manipulating the bits of a 16-bit integer. With BitFlip, you can perform various bitwise operations to flip even, odd, or all bits, as well as switch the left and right halves of the bits. 

Features:
Flip even bits using the XOR operator.
Flip odd bits using the XOR operator.
Flip all bits using the NOT operator.
Switch the left and right halves of the bits using the OR operator.
Output the manipulated results to the command line or an output file.
